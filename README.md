[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/siddhuwarrier/aws-api.svg?token=psjzrsiRHzBi3DhiqeaA&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/siddhuwarrier/aws-api)

This is a simple Scala application written using the Scalatra framework that retrieves a list of instances off AWS using
the EC2 API.

## Source Code

The source code is in a private Bitbucket repository. Please contact [Siddhu Warrier](mailto:siddhu@siddhuw.info) if you
wish to access it.

    git clone git@github.com:siddhuwarrier/aws-api.git

## API Documentation

> NOTE: I would replace this with Swagger or something similar in production. An alternate option would be to use a GraphQL API such as https://edge.us.cdo.cisco.com/api-explorer)

| Endpoint        | Params | Response  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| POST /auth      | BODY {"username": username, "password": password} | 200 with JSON containing JWT token, 401 UNAUTHORIZED if username and/or password are invalid) |
| GET /versions      |  | 200 with JSON containing git commit hash of latest commit |
| GET /health      |  | 200 with JSON containing git commit hash of latest commit if running |
| GET /api/aws/regions      | AUTHORIZATION header set with bearer token returned in  (Bearer `JWT token`)      |   200 with JSON of list of regions, 401 UNAUTHORIZED, 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS if you exceed the rate limit (managed using a token bucket algorithm  |
| GET /api/aws/ec2/instances | AUTHORIZATION header set with bearer token returned in  (Bearer `JWT token`)     |    200 with JSON of list of instances, 401 UNAUTHORIZED, 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS if you exceed the rate limit (managed using a token bucket algorithm, 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR (if AWS credentials invalid), 503 SERVICE UNAVAILABLE (if AWS inaccessible) |

## AWS deployment

This microservice is deployed in an ECS container (Fargate) deployed in a VPC behind an ALB to AWS eu-west-2 London and
can be accessed at `https://staging.awsapi.siddhuw.info`
(use the endpoints above with the right username and password to use it). The entire deployment process is automated:

- The AWS infrastructure is built using Terraform. See the git submodule in the `terraform`
  subdirectory (`git submodule update --init --recursive`).
- Every pull-request is built using AWS CodeBuild.
- On merge to master, an AWS CodePipeline is used to check out source, build a Docker image deployed to AWS ECR, and
  update the ECS containers.

This is how user requests are routed and handled.

```
User -> AWS ALB -> ECS Container (Fargate) <-> RDS Aurora (Postgres)
```

### Security

- NO AWS CREDENTIALS ARE DEPLOYED TO AWS. Instead, I use IAM roles associated with the ECS task in conjunction with the
  AWS default credentials chain to access the credentials.
- Neither the ECS containers nor the RDS instance are directly accessible from the public internet. A bastion host (
  t2.micro) is deployed in eu-west-2 with SSH access (secured using a RSA-4096 keypair), which can be used to access the
  RDS database using `psql` (this is what I used to add users that can authenticate against the app).
- All requests to the `/api/aws` endpoints are authenticated, requiring a JWT bearer token that can be generated by
  hitting the `auth` endpoint with a valid username and password. The username and the salted password hash are stored
  in the Postgres DB (I'd initially started out with Twitter OAuth, but for reasons I've now forgotten 6 years hence, I
  had to remove that). Please ask me if you'd like credentials to access it.

## Build and deploy instructions

### Pre-requisites

- Java 11
- Maven 3.6
- Docker Engine (if you wish to run the service locally)
- AWS credentials (if you wish to run the service locally)

To run just tests, type `mvn test`. This will also run the integration tests (which use an in-memory H2 database).

To generate a code coverage report, run

    mvn scoverage:report -Pcoverage

The scoverage report is produced in `target/site/scoverage/index.html`. Due to a bug in the scoverage Maven plugin, none
of the hyperlinks from the main page work. However, you can open each individual HTML file for each class manually.

### Running locally

To run the app locally, first set your AWS access key and secret access key in a file in the root of your repo
called `.env` (in an AWS deployment, we would use IAM roles):

``` 
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<enter-your-access-key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<enter-your-secret-access-key>
```

run:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

You can view the logs by typing:

```
docker logs -f <directory-name>_microservice_1
```

> Note: You may receive some warnings as Tomcat starts up.

The API should be accessible on http://localhost:8080. However, please note that you cannot access the API without first
authenticating.

The PostGres Docker container is initialised with a single user `admin` with the password `burak-crush-pineapple` (note:
the password is stored hashed and salted in the DB).

You can get a JWT token to make requests using this username and password as follows:

```
curl --silent http://localhost:8080/auth -X POST -d "{\"username\":\"admin\", \"password\":\"burak-crush-pineapple\"}" -H "Content-Type:application/json"
```

## Note on Logging

All logs are written in the `logstash` format. This would potentially allow for it to be fed into ElasticSearch and
viewed on Kibana.

## Future Work/Improvements

* Migration scripts for DB schema changes.
* API documentation using Swagger.
* Move hmac_key used to sign JWT tokens out of source control into configuration management.
* The OWSAP Enterprise Security API requires all logging go through log4j. Either switch to log4j or replace ESAPI.
